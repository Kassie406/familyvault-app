Great—let’s start with the feature that will deliver the most day-to-day value and get teens involved immediately:

Start with: Chores + Allowance (MVP)

…and add a tiny Action Center tile to the top of the dashboard so parents see “what needs attention” at a glance.

Why this first?

Daily engagement for kids/teens.

Clear parent workflow (approve/deny).

Easy wins to measure: chores done/week, approvals pending, points/allowance.

1) Data model (compact + future-proof)

Use whatever you have (SQL/Prisma/Firestore). Here’s a minimal shape you can map:

FamilyMember {
  id: string;
  familyId: string;
  name: string;
  role: "parent" | "teen" | "child";
  avatarUrl?: string;
}

Chore {
  id: string;
  familyId: string;
  title: string;                 // "Dishes", "Trash", "Walk dog"
  details?: string;              // short instructions
  assigneeId: string;            // FamilyMember.id
  dueAt: string;                 // ISO
  points: number;                // 5–20 typical
  status: "todo" | "done" | "approved";
  createdById: string;           // parent
  createdAt: string;             // ISO
  rotationKey?: string;          // group chores that rotate together
}

AllowanceLedger {
  id: string;
  familyId: string;
  memberId: string;
  deltaPoints: number;           // +points on approval, negative for penalties
  reason: string;                // "Chore: Dishes 2025-09-07"
  createdAt: string;
  createdById: string;           // parent
}


Permissions:

Parents: create/assign/rotate, approve/deny, edit, adjust ledger.

Teen/Child: mark done only for their own chores; cannot approve.

2) API endpoints (clean + role-aware)
GET    /api/chores?since=<iso>&assigneeId=<id|me>   // list (family scoped)
POST   /api/chores                                   // create
PATCH  /api/chores/:id                               // edit (parents)
POST   /api/chores/:id/done                          // child/teen self mark
POST   /api/chores/:id/approve                       // parents -> approved + ledger
POST   /api/chores/rotate                            // rotate a set (by rotationKey)
GET    /api/allowance/summary?memberId=<id|me>       // points balance + history


Server rules:

All queries filtered by familyId from session.

Validate roles per route (parents only for approve/rotate/edit).

On approve:

status = "approved"

append AllowanceLedger{ deltaPoints = chore.points }.

3) Dashboard UI (what to add now)
A) Action Center (top, small tile)

“2 chores to approve • 3 due today • 1 meal unplanned”

Click → opens Chores panel (anchor link).

This keeps the dashboard focused and actionable.

B) Chores card (two tabs)

My chores (for current user): checklist with big “Mark done”.

Family (parents default): table/list grouped by person with Approve buttons.

Empty/Loading/Error states:

Loading skeleton rows.

Empty text: “No chores due—add one.”

Error toast with Retry.

Micro-interactions:

Optimistic UI for done.

When parent approves, row animates → fades to “Approved ✓” and ledger increments.

4) Rotation (simple but powerful)

Give recurring/rotating chores a shared rotationKey (e.g., "evening-dishes").

POST /api/chores/rotate:

Find all chores with rotationKey scheduled for the next period (e.g., next week).

Rotate assignee across the family member list (parents can exclude themselves).

5) Allowance view (MVP)

In profile menu (or a small card):
Points: 145 (This month) • View history

Parents can convert points → allowance payout (manual now; automate later).

6) Acceptance criteria (so we know it’s done)

Parents can: create chores, see Approvals Pending, approve → points ledger updates.

Teens/children can: see My chores, mark done; can’t approve/edit.

Dashboard Action Center shows correct counts (approvals pending, due today).

Everything loads in parallel; no console errors; first render < 2.5s.

Unit tests for role enforcement (kids can’t approve/edit).

Analytics: events for chore_done, chore_approved, rotation_run.

7) Rollout plan (low risk)

Ship endpoints + “My chores” tab (self-serve completion).

Add “Family” tab + approvals for parents.

Add Action Center tile.

Enable rotation and points ledger.

Add Allowance mini-view.
