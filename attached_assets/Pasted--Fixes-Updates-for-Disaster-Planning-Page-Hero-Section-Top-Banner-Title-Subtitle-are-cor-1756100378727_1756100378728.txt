🔧 Fixes & Updates for Disaster Planning Page

Hero Section (Top Banner)

✅ Title & Subtitle are correct.

⚠️ The “Get Started Free” button color and hover effect should match the same yellow button style across all pages (make sure the hover state uses the same background shade).

⚠️ The subtitle text (“A natural disaster…”) should use the same font-weight and gray tone as other subpages.

Testimonial Section (Wildfire Story)

⚠️ Right now, it looks slightly misaligned compared to other testimonial sections.

✅ Keep the text and video embed, but ensure font size and spacing match the testimonial sections in International Travel and Moving.

✅ Background should stay black with consistent padding.

How FamilyVault Helps Section

✅ Good use of icons + cards.

⚠️ The card borders and hover effects should match Elderly Parents and Getting Married (thin border highlight on hover).

✅ Keep icons in the same golden color as other sections.

Detailed Features Section (Contacts, Medical, Pets, Insurance)

⚠️ Ensure card alignment is consistent (some screenshots show uneven gaps).

⚠️ Text should match line-height and font-weight of the International Travel feature cards.

✅ Icons should stay gold, but add hover highlight effects like the Digital Security page.

Meet FamilyVault Section

✅ Present and styled correctly.

⚠️ Align the three feature blocks (Backup, Browse, Experts) to match the exact padding used on other pages.

Security Section

✅ Security icons are consistent.

⚠️ Ensure the yellow highlight on "About our security" link matches other pages.

Testimonials Section

⚠️ Current testimonial cards look slightly heavier (bold outlines).
→ Make them consistent with Moving Page (light border, subtle hover effect).

⚠️ Ensure star icons are the same shade of yellow used elsewhere.

Closing CTA (Bottom Banner)

✅ Good use of "Be ready for anything life throws your way".

⚠️ Ensure gradient background matches other page footers (fade-to-black with gold highlight).

✅ Button style must match all other closing CTA buttons.
