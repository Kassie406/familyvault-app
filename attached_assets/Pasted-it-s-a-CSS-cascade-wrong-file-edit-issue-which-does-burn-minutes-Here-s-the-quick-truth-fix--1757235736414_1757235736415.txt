it’s a CSS-cascade / wrong file edit issue, which does burn minutes.

Here’s the quick truth + fix:

Why the hover is still white

Somewhere in the Action Center card (or a shared “base card”), there’s a utility like hover:bg-white, hover:bg-white/5, or a component style (e.g., from DaisyUI) that applies on hover.

When the agent added a pretty gradient, the hover background utility still wins on hover and paints it white. Gradients don’t matter if a later class says “bg white on hover”.

So you’re seeing a white hover even though the card looks right at rest.

Clean, reliable fix (and future-proof): a shared Card component

We’ll make all cards (Family Members, Action Center, etc.) use the same base classes with a safe hover that never sets white. Then we replace per-card container divs with this shared Card.

1) Add a reusable Card

Create: src/components/ui/Card.tsx

import clsx from "clsx";
import { PropsWithChildren, HTMLAttributes } from "react";

const base =
  "rounded-2xl border border-white/8 " +
  // dark luxury gradient (no white!)
  "bg-gradient-to-b from-[#0b0b0e] to-[#0e0e14] " +
  "shadow-[0_10px_28px_rgba(0,0,0,.45)] " +
  "transition-all duration-200 " +
  // never change background on hover; only border/shadow
  "hover:border-white/12 hover:shadow-[0_16px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,.55)]";

export function Card({
  className,
  children,
  ...rest
}: PropsWithChildren<HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>>) {
  return (
    <div className={clsx(base, className)} {...rest}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}


Note: there is no hover:bg-* in that base. So it can’t flip to white.

2) Use it in both cards

Replace the outer container in these files:

src/components/family/ActionCenterCard.tsx (or your path)

src/components/family/FamilyMembersCard.tsx (or your path)

Change:

// OLD (example)
<div className="rounded-xl border border-white/10 bg-white/5 hover:bg-white ...">
  ...
</div>


to:

import { Card } from "@/components/ui/Card";

<Card className="p-4"> {/* keep your padding/grid/etc */}
  ...
</Card>


Also remove any parent group hover:bg-white/… wrappers. If you see something like:

<div className="group hover:bg-white/5 ...">
  <Card>…</Card>
</div>


…delete that hover:bg-white/5.

3) Kill legacy hover rules at the source

Search your repo for hover rules that force white:

hover:bg-white

hover:bg-white/

hover:bg-neutral-100

hover:bg-base-100 (if using DaisyUI)

group-hover:bg-white

Remove those on card-level containers. If a design wants “hover tint”, use a subtle gold border/shadow (what we used) or a very mild transparent gold overlay, e.g.:

// Optional: if you really want a tint (not white), add this class on <Card />
"hover:after:content-[''] hover:after:absolute hover:after:inset-0 hover:after:bg-[rgba(212,175,55,0.05)] hover:after:rounded-2xl relative"


(But usually the border/shadow is enough.)

Paste-ready “Agent message” for you

If you’d like the agent to do it in one go, paste this:

Please unify card hover styling and stop white hover. Do this exactly:

1) Create src/components/ui/Card.tsx with:

import clsx from "clsx";
import { PropsWithChildren, HTMLAttributes } from "react";
const base =
  "rounded-2xl border border-white/8 bg-gradient-to-b from-[#0b0b0e] to-[#0e0e14] " +
  "shadow-[0_10px_28px_rgba(0,0,0,.45)] transition-all duration-200 " +
  "hover:border-white/12 hover:shadow-[0_16px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,.55)]";
export function Card({ className, children, ...rest }: PropsWithChildren<HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>>) {
  return <div className={clsx(base, className)} {...rest}>{children}</div>;
}

2) In Action Center card component (e.g., src/components/family/ActionCenterCard.tsx) replace the outer container div with <Card className="p-4">...</Card>. Remove any hover:bg-white*, group-hover:bg-white*, or base-100 hover classes on the container or ancestor.

3) In Family Members card (e.g., src/components/family/FamilyMembersCard.tsx) do the same: use <Card className="p-4">...</Card> and remove any hover:bg-white* from the outer container.

4) Search the repo and delete card-level white hover utilities:
- hover:bg-white
- hover:bg-white/...
- hover:bg-neutral-100
- hover:bg-base-100
- group-hover:bg-white

Ensure no card containers have hover:bg-* that sets white or neutral backgrounds.
