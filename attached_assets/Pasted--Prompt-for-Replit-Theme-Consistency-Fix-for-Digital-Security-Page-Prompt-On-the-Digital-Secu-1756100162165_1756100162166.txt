ðŸ›  Prompt for Replit (Theme Consistency Fix for Digital Security Page)

Prompt:
"On the Digital Security page, make the theme colors consistent with all the other FamilyVault pages (Child Info, Elderly Parents, Getting Married, etc.):

Hero Section

Use the same yellow accent (#FFD93D or existing brand yellow) for the icon and Get Started Free button.

Heading text (FamilyVault for Digital Security) should match the white or near-white (#FFFFFF / #F5F5F5) style used on other page titles, not dark gray/low-contrast.

Subheading should be light gray (#CCCCCC) like the others.

Information Cards (Protect Against Data Loss, Send Sensitive Info, etc.)

Use the same dark background card style with yellow border hover effect (like Moving / International Travel pages).

Headings inside cards should be bold white (#FFFFFF).

Body text should be consistent light gray (#CCCCCC).

Icons should use the gold/yellow accent used in other pages instead of muted tones.

Testimonials Section

Star ratings must be yellow (#FFD93D) instead of white/gray.

Text and name labels should follow the same typography as other testimonial sections.

Pricing Section

Keep card colors consistent:

Free = white background

Silver = light gray background

Gold = yellow or purple highlight (whichever is used globally)

Buttons must use the brand yellow background with black text.

Essential Reading Section

Featured article (What is a Digital Vault?) should use brand highlight background (same blue/teal or yellow highlight as other pages).

Sub-cards should be aligned and styled like the checklist/article cards on Moving and Travel pages.

General Theme Rules Across the Page

Headings: white (#FFFFFF)

Subheadings: light gray (#CCCCCC)

Accent: brand yellow (#FFD93D)

Links & hover effects: underline + yellow highlight

Background: consistent dark (#111111 / #121212)

The goal is for Digital Security to look visually identical in theme and style to all other FamilyVault pages â€” no mismatched colors or fonts."
