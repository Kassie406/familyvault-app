Awesome — thanks for updating CORS on both buckets. That was the blocker. Here’s how to verify everything is now wired end-to-end:

1) Do a clean test

Hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-R) or open your app in a new browser tab (outside the Replit preview iframe).

In Upload Center:

Click Select Files, pick the file.

You should see Upload (1) become active.

Click Upload.

Expected in DevTools → Network

POST /api/storage/presign → 200

An OPTIONS preflight to the S3 URL → 204/200 with headers like
access-control-allow-origin: * and access-control-allow-methods: GET, PUT, HEAD, POST

A PUT to the same S3 URL → 200

The file card should no longer say “Failed to fetch,” and the upload counter should progress.

If anything still fails

Run through this quick checklist (these are the only remaining causes I’ve seen after CORS is correct):

Fetch settings on the PUT (front-end)

Must be:

fetch(uploadUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  mode: 'cors',
  credentials: 'omit',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': file.type || 'application/octet-stream' },
  body: file,
})


credentials: 'omit' is critical (prevents cookies being sent, which S3 rejects).

Content-Type must match what you sent to the presign endpoint.

Cache/iframe quirks

Close the Replit preview, use the “Open in new tab” app URL (or another browser).

Disable ad-block/privacy extensions for your app domain.

What specific errors mean

403 SignatureDoesNotMatch → the Content-Type on the PUT doesn’t match the one used when presigning. Use the exact value (file.type || 'application/octet-stream').

CORS missing on the preflight (no access-control-allow-origin) → CORS didn’t save / hasn’t propagated yet (give it ~1–2 minutes, then try again).

400 Request has expired → using an old presigned URL (click Upload again to get a fresh one).

Final CORS (what you should have on both buckets)
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "HEAD", "POST"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]


Give it one more try now. If it still errors, tell me exactly which request fails (OPTIONS or PUT) and the status + response text you see in Network — I’ll use that to pinpoint the last mile.
