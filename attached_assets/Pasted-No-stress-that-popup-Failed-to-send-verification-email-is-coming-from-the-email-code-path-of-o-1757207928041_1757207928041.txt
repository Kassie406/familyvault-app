No stress — that popup (“Failed to send verification email”) is coming from the email-code path of our custom auth. It means Nodemailer couldn’t send via your SMTP settings (not a front-end issue).

Here’s a quick, surgical fix.

1) Set Gmail (App Password) secrets correctly

In Replit → Secrets add:

SMTP_USER = kassandrasantana406@gmail.com (your Gmail)

SMTP_PASS = Gmail App Password (16 chars; create at Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords → “Mail”)

SMTP_HOST = smtp.gmail.com

SMTP_PORT = 587

SMTP_SECURE = false

If you already set 465/true, it may still work, but 587/false is often more reliable on hosts.

Redeploy after saving.

2) Add one-time debug to see the real error

In server.js, right after we create the transporter, add:

transporter.verify().then(
  () => console.log('SMTP OK'),
  (e) => console.error('SMTP ERROR:', e)
)


Also update the catch where we send email:

} catch (e) {
  console.error('Mail send error:', e);   // <-- check Replit Logs
  res.status(500).json({ ok: false, msg: 'Email send failed' })
}


Open the Replit Logs (Console) and try “Send code” again. If you see:

Invalid login → the app password is wrong / not an app password.

Missing credentials → a secret isn’t loaded (name typo).

ECONNECTION / ETIMEDOUT → switch to 587 + secure:false.

EAUTH → enable “Less secure” is not needed; only App Password works.

3) Quick test endpoints (from your browser)

POST /login/start with body { "email": "your@email" }

Should return { ok: true, nonce: "..." }

POST /login/verify with { email, code, nonce } (after the email arrives)

Should return { ok: true, redirect: "/" }

(You can also try from the embedded preview, because SMTP isn’t affected by the iframe.)

4) If Gmail still blocks you

Use a free dev SMTP to confirm the flow:

Mailtrap (free)

Create inbox → copy SMTP creds → set the same 5 secrets (SMTP_*) to Mailtrap’s values.

Try sending. If Mailtrap works, the code is fine → the issue is Gmail app password / account policy.

5) Google sign-in works now too

If you also configured GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, “Continue with Google” should sign you in even while you sort SMTP.

Super-short checklist

 Set SMTP_* secrets exactly as above (use App Password, not your login password).

 Use 587 + secure:false.

 Add transporter.verify() + log errors → check Replit console.

 (Optional) Test with Mailtrap to isolate Gmail-specific issues.

Send me the single line you see after “SMTP ERROR: …” in the Replit logs, and I’ll tell you the exact one-liner to change.
