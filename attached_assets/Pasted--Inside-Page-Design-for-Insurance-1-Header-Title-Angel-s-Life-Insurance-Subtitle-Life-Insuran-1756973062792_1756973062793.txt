🗂 Inside-Page Design for Insurance
1. Header

Title: Angel’s Life Insurance

Subtitle: Life Insurance · 3 items

Right side:

+ Add Item (gold button)

Search bar (dark-gray input, placeholder “Search insurance details…”)

2. Core Sections (as expandable cards)

Just like “Home, Devices, Subscriptions” in Passwords, you’ll have expandable sections:

📄 Policy Details

Policy Number

Provider Name (ex: Prudential, Aetna)

Coverage Type (Life / Term / Whole / Medical / Auto / etc.)

Start Date / Renewal Date

Premium Amount

👥 Insured Members

Primary Insured

Spouse / Dependents

Beneficiaries

💰 Financials

Premium Payments (monthly, yearly)

Payment Method (Bank / Card / Payroll deduction)

Coverage Amount (ex: $250,000)

📂 Documents

Upload scanned policy docs (PDF / images)

Attach claim forms, ID copies, etc.

Show preview (like Family IDs attachment style).

3. UI Elements

Reveal / Copy buttons next to sensitive fields (Policy #, Account #).

Category Tags: (Life, Medical, Auto, Umbrella, etc.) for filtering.

Activity Log: “Policy renewed on X date”, “Beneficiary updated”.

4. Styling

Dark background (same as Passwords + Family IDs).

Gold accents for icons + section headers.

Expandable cards with rounded corners + hover highlight.

Consistency: Copy the layout from Password Managers so users feel it’s one ecosystem.

⚡ This way, every Insurance card acts like a mini-vault for all policy details, just like the Passwords vault.
All modules (Passwords, Family IDs, Finance, Insurance) will now follow the same UX structure.
