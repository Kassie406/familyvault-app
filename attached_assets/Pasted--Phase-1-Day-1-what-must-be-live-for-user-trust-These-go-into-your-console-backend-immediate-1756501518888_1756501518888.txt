🔒 Phase 1 (Day-1: what must be live for user trust)

These go into your console + backend immediately:

Authentication / Account Security

Passkeys (WebAuthn) as primary → fallback MFA (TOTP / magic link).

Argon2id hashing, secure session cookies (HttpOnly, SameSite=strict, Secure).

New device login email alert + device manager in user profile.

Document Security

Signed URLs for file access (5-min expiry).

Antivirus scan on upload (ClamAV container or Uploadcare).

No public buckets, no unscanned uploads.

Database / Tenant Isolation

Postgres with row-level security (RLS) so one family/org can never peek at another’s data.

Every query scoped by org_id.

Transport / Web Security

Cloudflare in front: TLS 1.3, HSTS, WAF enabled.

Helmet + strict CSP, CSRF protection for POST/PUT/DELETE.

Audit & Logs

Immutable audit log: every login, share, upload, delete.

Console “Recent Activity” feed visible to PRESIDENT role.

Backups

Nightly encrypted DB backups.

Object storage with versioning.

🛡️ Phase 2 (First 30–60 days)

Enhancements to reassure families:

Encryption Envelope: Each org gets its own data encryption key (DEK), rotated periodically, wrapped in a KMS key.

Security Center in Console:

Cards: Database ✅, Storage ✅, Auth ✅, WAF ✅.

Alerts if anything FAILs.

Device Binding: tie sessions to device fingerprints; revoke from console.

Incident Response:

Automated email/SMS escalation for critical system issues.

Status page (status.familycirclesecure.com).

🧾 Phase 3 (Beyond 60 days — Compliance & polish)

Privacy center: cookie consent, GDPR/CCPA data export + delete.

SOC2/ISO27001 prep (even just self-attested).

Pentest or bug bounty (HackerOne Lite).

Security score in dashboard: “Your family’s vault is 100% secure (last audit 2d ago).”

🖥️ In the Console (what you show the PRESIDENT)

System Status widget (OK/FAIL cards).

Recent Activity stream (logins, doc views, downloads).

Quick Actions (Revoke user, Rotate keys, Export audit).

Compliance tab (download privacy policy, last SOC audit).

Incident log (with optional SMS/email escalation).

👉 My recommendation:
Let’s lock in Phase 1 immediately. That’s what prevents data breaches. Phase 2 + 3 make it enterprise-grade and give families confidence (“they can see the security”).
