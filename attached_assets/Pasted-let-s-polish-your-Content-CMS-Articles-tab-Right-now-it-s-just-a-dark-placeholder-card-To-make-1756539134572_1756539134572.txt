let‚Äôs polish your Content (CMS & Articles) tab. Right now it‚Äôs just a dark placeholder card. To make it as useful and polished as your Subscription Plans and Coupons sections, here‚Äôs how we can transform it:

‚úÖ Current Strengths

Clear label: Content Management.

Good empty state skeleton (icon, title, subtext).

‚öñÔ∏è Improvements
1. Lighter Empty State

Like we did for Coupons, switch from the black card to a light card with border/shadow. It‚Äôll feel friendlier and more consistent.

2. Explain Content Purpose

Add a description that tells admins exactly what content they can manage here:

Announcements (system updates)

Knowledge base / help articles

FamilyCircle Secure news & blog posts

3. Empty State CTA

Add a big ‚Äú+ Create Article‚Äù button, centered in the empty state.
Secondary button: ‚ÄúImport from Template‚Äù (for admins who want to pull starter content).

4. Once Articles Exist ‚Üí Table View

Show a table, just like Plans/Coupons, with sortable columns:

Title	Category	Author	Published	Status	Actions
Welcome Guide	Onboarding	Admin	08/25/2025	Published	Edit / Archive
System Outage FAQ	Support	Sarah M.	08/20/2025	Draft	Edit / Publish
Billing Update	Announcements	Michael R.	08/10/2025	Published	Edit / Archive
5. Create/Edit Article Modal

Similar style to your other modals:

Fields:

Title (required)

Category (Onboarding, Support, Announcements, Blog, Other)

Content (rich text editor / Markdown)

Status (Draft / Published)

Publish date (optional future scheduling)

6. Filtering & Bulk Actions

At top, filters for:

Category (dropdown)

Status (Published / Draft)

Search (by title or content snippet)

Bulk actions: Publish, Unpublish, Archive, Export.

üîë Suggested Empty State Layout (HTML mockup)
<div class="empty-state">
  <div class="icon">üìÑ</div>
  <h3>No Content Yet</h3>
  <p>Create and manage articles, announcements, or support docs for your users and team.</p>
  <div class="actions">
    <button class="btn primary">+ Create Article</button>
    <button class="btn ghost">Import from Template</button>
  </div>
</div>

‚≠ê Bonus Idea

Add a Preview Mode toggle ‚Äî so admins can see how the article will look for:

Public Clients (familycirclesecure.com)

Family Portal Users (portal.familycirclesecure.com)

Staff / Agents (hub.familycirclesecure.com)

This keeps your 3-group structure consistent across all content.
