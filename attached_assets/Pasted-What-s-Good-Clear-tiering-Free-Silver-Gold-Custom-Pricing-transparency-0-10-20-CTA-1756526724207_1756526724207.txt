What’s Good

Clear tiering (Free → Silver → Gold → Custom)

Pricing transparency ($0, $10, $20)

CTA buttons (“Get started”, “Schedule a demo”) are obvious and bright

⚖️ Improvements
1. Separate Client Plans vs Internal Plans

Right now everything is under “Subscription Plans.” To avoid confusion:

Client Users (www.familycirclesecure.com
) → Free, Silver, Gold, Custom

Family Members (portal.familycirclesecure.com) → should NOT see billing options (maybe always free, role-based access only)

Employees/Agents (hub.familycirclesecure.com) → no billing, just role/permission management

👉 In your console, you could show tabs or filters:

Plans → [Client Plans] [Family Plans] [Staff Plans]

2. Better Hierarchy in Cards

Make “Most Popular” (Silver or Gold) visually stand out (bigger, badge, shadow).

Add hover effects on cards (transform: scale(1.02); box-shadow: …).

Ensure contrast (yellow on black works, but check WCAG for accessibility).

3. Stripe Integration Ready

Each “Get started” should:

Kick off Stripe Checkout / Customer Portal directly.

Auto-assign user to tenant=Public and update their role (Client / Client+ / Gold).

4. Suggested Console Layout for Client Plans

Instead of a dead “No Plans Configured” card, show them like this in your Admin console:

Plan Name	Price	Interval	Users on Plan	Status	Actions
Free	$0	Forever	128 users	Active	Edit / Disable
Silver	$10	Monthly	43 users	Active	Edit / Disable
Gold	$20	Monthly	25 users	Active	Edit / Disable
Custom	N/A	Custom	8 users	Active	Manage

⚡ That way, as an admin, you see plan adoption and can manage Stripe integration.

5. User-Facing vs Admin-Facing

User-facing (on www site): Nice marketing cards (like your screenshot).

Admin-facing (in console): Simple table with pricing + # of users on each plan.

🔑 Recommended Fix for Console (Empty State)

If no plans exist → instead of black box, show:

“No Client Plans Configured”
Connect Stripe and import your Free, Silver, Gold, and Custom tiers.
