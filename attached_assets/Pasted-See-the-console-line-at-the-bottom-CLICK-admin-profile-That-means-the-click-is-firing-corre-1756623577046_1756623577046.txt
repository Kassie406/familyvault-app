See the console line at the bottom:

[CLICK] → /admin/profile


That means the click is firing correctly and React Router is trying to navigate to /admin/profile.
But your URL in the browser is still /admin/dashboard. That means one of two things is happening:

🔍 What’s happening

You have a guard or redirect in AdminRouter that is forcing everything back to /dashboard.
Example:

<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/admin/dashboard" replace />} />


If this catch-all is before your /admin/profile route, the router never shows Profile.

The Profile/Settings components are not imported or not declared as routes.
So React Router says “no match” → falls into the redirect back to dashboard.

✅ Fix

Open your App.tsx (or wherever AdminRouter is defined) and make sure it looks like this:

import { Routes, Route, Navigate } from "react-router-dom";
import AdminLayout from "./components/admin/AdminLayout";
import Dashboard from "./pages/admin/Dashboard";
import Profile from "./pages/admin/Profile";
import Settings from "./pages/admin/Settings";

function AdminRouter() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/admin" element={<AdminLayout />}>
        <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path="profile" element={<Profile />} />
        <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
        {/* 👇 keep catch-all LAST */}
        <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="dashboard" replace />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default AdminRouter;

🚨 Key things to check

Profile.tsx and Settings.tsx exist in /pages/admin/.

They export a React component (e.g., export default function Profile() { return <h1>Profile</h1>; }).

The <Route path="profile" ... /> and <Route path="settings" ... /> lines appear above any wildcard (*) redirect.

Your links in the menu use /admin/profile and /admin/settings:

<NavLink to="/admin/profile">Profile</NavLink>
<NavLink to="/admin/settings">Settings</NavLink>


👉 If you send me your App.tsx (or wherever routes are declared), I can rewrite the exact section for you so clicking Profile/Settings will finally load their pages instead of bouncing to Dashboard.
