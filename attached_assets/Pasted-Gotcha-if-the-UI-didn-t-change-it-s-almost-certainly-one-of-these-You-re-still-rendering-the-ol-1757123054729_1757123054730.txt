Gotcha — if the UI didn’t change, it’s almost certainly one of these:

You’re still rendering the old component (not the new panel).

Tailwind didn’t rebuild the classes (new file path isn’t included in content globs).

A cascading style is overriding the card styles.

Here’s a quick, surgical fix list.

1) Make sure you’re rendering the new panel

In your dashboard page, replace whatever you currently render for Family Updates with:

// client/src/pages/family/dashboard.tsx (or wherever your card is)
import FamilyUpdatesPanel from "@/components/family/FamilyUpdatesPanel";

<Card className="bg-zinc-900 border border-zinc-800 rounded-2xl">
  <FamilyUpdatesPanel />
</Card>


Remove/disable the previous FamilyUpdates, SnoozedList, or inline markup so we only have one source of truth.

2) Ensure Tailwind picks up the new files

If Tailwind didn’t see the new component path, the new classes won’t exist (so it looks unchanged).

tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./client/index.html",
    "./client/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",     // ✅ make sure this covers:
    "./client/src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}", //   components/family/**/*
    "./client/src/pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
};


Then restart your dev server so Tailwind rebuilds.

3) Verify global CSS is applied

Make sure your global stylesheet (with Tailwind base/components/utilities + shadcn styles) is imported:

// client/src/main.tsx or _app.tsx
import "./styles/globals.css";  // must include @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;

4) Clear any stale markup and check for overrides

Open DevTools → Inspect a card:

You should see rounded-2xl border border-zinc-800 bg-zinc-900 p-4.

If those classes appear but look wrong, search “Styles” for any overriding CSS (e.g., .card { border-radius: 0 }).

5) Minimal style diff (drop into your panel if needed)

If you want to force the styling beyond any overrides, this is the exact wrapper used in the consolidated panel:

<div className="rounded-2xl border border-zinc-800 bg-zinc-900 p-4 flex justify-between items-start">
  {/* left (title/body/meta) */}
  {/* right (actions) */}
</div>


And the “Open” button variant:

<Button
  size="sm"
  variant="outline"
  className="border-yellow-500/30 text-yellow-400 hover:bg-yellow-500/10"
>
  Open
</Button>

6) Quick sanity checks

Restart the dev server (or Replit “Run”) after config changes.

Confirm the import path is correct: @/components/family/FamilyUpdatesPanel resolves to the new file.

If you’re using module aliases, ensure tsconfig.json has "@/*": ["client/src/*"] (or your project’s structure).
