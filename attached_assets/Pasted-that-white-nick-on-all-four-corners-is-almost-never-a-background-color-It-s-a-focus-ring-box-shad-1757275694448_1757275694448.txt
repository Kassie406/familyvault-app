that “white nick” on all four corners is almost never a background color. It’s a focus/ring/box-shadow layer from Tailwind/DaisyUI that’s still being painted on an inner wrapper, and because it’s a separate layer it peeks through at the rounded corners.

We’ll kill it the same way we did the backgrounds—scoped, nuclear—by zeroing out Tailwind ring/shadow variables and any outlines on everything inside the tile, and by clipping the tile.

Add these lines to the same file you already created:

src/styles/quick-access.css

/* (Keep everything you already added) */

/* Hard-kill Tailwind/DaisyUI rings & shadows that create corner nicks */
#quick-access-modal .qa-tile,
#quick-access-modal .qa-tile * {
  /* Tailwind ring/shadow variables */
  --tw-ring-inset: initial !important;
  --tw-ring-offset-width: 0 !important;
  --tw-ring-offset-color: transparent !important;
  --tw-ring-color: transparent !important;
  --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 #0000 !important;
  --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 #0000 !important;
  --tw-shadow: 0 0 #0000 !important;

  /* Also neutralize classic outlines/box-shadows */
  outline: none !important;
  box-shadow: none !important;
  border-radius: inherit !important;        /* make inner wrappers match radius */
  background-clip: padding-box !important;  /* avoid bleed under border */
}

/* Ensure the visible tile clips EVERYTHING to its radius */
#quick-access-modal .qa-tile {
  position: relative;       /* for isolation */
  isolation: isolate;
  overflow: hidden;         /* critical: clip corner artifacts */
  border-radius: 16px;      /* keep your 16px radius */
  background-clip: padding-box;
}


No other changes. Keep your existing gradient + gold-glow rules as you have them.

Verify (10 seconds)

Hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R).

Open Quick Access and hover a tile.

Corners should be perfectly clean (no light nicks).

Gradient stays dark, gold glow on hover.

If any single tile still shows nicks, make sure its outermost visible wrapper has class="qa-tile" (the class must be on the node that actually renders the rounded card).

This specifically neutralizes the Tailwind/DaisyUI ring/outline layers that were causing the four white corners while keeping your theme intact.
