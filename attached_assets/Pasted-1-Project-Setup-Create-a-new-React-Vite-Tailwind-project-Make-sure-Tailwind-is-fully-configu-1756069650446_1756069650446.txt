1. Project Setup
Create a new React + Vite + Tailwind project.  
Make sure Tailwind is fully configured with index.css and tailwind.config.js.  
I want a clean layout system with reusable sections and no JSX nesting errors.  

2. Navbar
Build a sticky navbar at the top with:  
- Logo text on the left (FamilyVault placeholder)  
- Links: Use Cases, Security, Pricing, Resources  
- On the right: Login button and "Get Started Free" button  
Use Tailwind classes, keep it responsive, mobile collapses into a hamburger.  

3. Hero Section
Create a hero section with two columns:  
Left column: Large heading, subheading text, and two buttons (Get Started Free, See How It Works).  
Right column: Rounded image placeholder (like a laptop mockup).  
Add background that is clean and white.  

4. Feature Checklist
Add a section titled "Secure Everything That Matters".  
Two columns of checklist items with icons (checkmarks).  
In the middle column, put an image placeholder box that says "Document Collage".  
Use Tailwind grid and spacing.  

5. Stats Section
Add a section with 3 equal-width cards.  
Each card has: title, description, and a small source note.  
Example: "You lose 51+ hours a year - Trying to stay on top of household paperwork".  
Keep it centered and clean.  

6. Benefits Section
Create a two-column section.  
Left: Image placeholder (video thumbnail with play button).  
Right: Title "Life is Easier with FamilyVault" and 3 benefit cards stacked vertically.  
Each benefit card has a bold title and small text.  

7. Security Grid
Make a section with 6 cards in a grid (2 per row on desktop).  
Each card has an icon, a title, and a description.  
Example: Multi-factor Authentication, Tokenization, Threat Detection.  

8. Testimonials
Add a testimonials section with 6 profile cards.  
Each card has a circle avatar placeholder, name, and "Member since 2024".  
Grid should be responsive.  

9. FAQ Accordion
Build a FAQ section with 3–5 questions.  
Each question is clickable, expands to show the answer.  
Use Tailwind, keep it simple and collapsible.  

10. Footer
Add a footer with © 2024 FamilyVault on the left.  
On the right: links for Privacy, Terms, Security.  
Background light gray with padding.  


⚡ Pro Tips for Prompts

Always say: “Use one root div per section to avoid adjacent JSX element errors” → this prevents crashes.

Always say: “Use Tailwind for all styling, don’t add custom CSS unless necessary.”

Always say: “Keep components small and separated, not one giant file.”
