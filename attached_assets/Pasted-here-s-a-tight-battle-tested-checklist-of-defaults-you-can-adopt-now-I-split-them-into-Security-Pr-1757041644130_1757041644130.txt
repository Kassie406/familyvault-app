here’s a tight, battle-tested checklist of defaults you can adopt now. I split them into Security/Privacy, Performance/Scaling, and Developer-Ops & UX so you can hand this to your devs as requirements.

5) Notes & good defaults
A) Security & Privacy (do these first)

1) Authentication & Session

Use HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookies for sessions.

Set short session idle (e.g., 30 min) + refresh token (7–14 days).

Enforce step-up auth (TOTP/WebAuthn/password re-auth) before revealing secrets/credentials.

2) Authorization

Scope every request by familyId and caller’s role:

viewer → read only

editor → create/update own family content

admin → delete, manage roles & sharing

3) Upload constraints

In /api/storage/presign, whitelist MIME & size per type:

document: application/pdf, image/*, text/plain, <= 25 MB

photo: image/jpeg|png|heic, <= 10 MB

Reject unknown types; show friendly errors.

4) Malware scanning (docs/photos)

Queue each uploaded file for AV scan (e.g., ClamAV or Cloudflare AV).

Mark file as quarantined until clean; block download if not clean.

5) PII / legal care (you’re a paralegal)

Keep audit logs for: invite create/accept, share create/revoke, credential reveal/copy, document download.

Data retention: define a policy (e.g., deleted items retained in cold storage for 30 days, then purged).

Add export my data and delete my account endpoints (compliance).

Display last access & active sessions; allow remote sign-out.

6) Transport & browser protections

Enforce HTTPS and set headers:

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload

X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()

CSP (tune sources):

Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  img-src 'self' data: https://cdn.familycirclesecure.com;
  script-src 'self';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  connect-src 'self' https://api.your-s3-endpoint.com;
  frame-ancestors 'none';


Set download Content-Disposition when serving files to avoid inline execution.

7) Secrets management

Store all creds in env (not in repo). Rotate S3 keys quarterly; least-privilege IAM per bucket.

8) Rate-limit & abuse controls

IP + user based limits for login, invite, reveal/copy, share endpoints (e.g., 5/min/credential; 50/10 min/invite).

B) Performance, Storage & Scaling

1) CDN & caching

Serve photos/doc previews from a CDN domain (PUBLIC_CDN_BASE).

Cache document lists for 15–30s per family in memory (or Redis).

Use cursor pagination everywhere (documents/photos/messages).

2) Image pipeline

Store originals, generate:

thumb (256px), grid (1024px) using a worker (Sharp, Cloudflare Images, or Lambda).

Save derived keys in DB for fast gallery loads.

3) Background jobs

Pick a lightweight queue: BullMQ (Redis) or Cloudflare Queues.

Jobs: AV scan, image resize, email invites, audit exports, stale link cleanup.

4) Storage layout

Key pattern: family/{familyId}/{type}s/{YYYY}/{MM}/{uuid}-{sanitized-name}

Keep a per-family soft quota (e.g., 5 GB default); show usage in settings.

5) Database

Indices you’ll want early:

documents(family_id, created_at desc)

photos(family_id, created_at desc)

activities(family_id, created_at desc)

invitations(token unique)

Nightly VACUUM/ANALYZE or managed Postgres settings.

6) Observability

Centralized logs (pino → Logtail/Datadog).

Metrics: request rate, latency, error %, queue depth, upload failures, AV results.

Traces around presign → upload → attach to spot bottlenecks.

C) Developer-Ops & UX defaults

1) Environments

dev, staging, prod with isolated DB and buckets.

Feature flags for risky changes (ConfigCat/Unleash).

2) Migrations

One migration per change; never hot-edit tables in prod.

Blue/green strategy for breaking changes (deploy DB first with backward-compatible schema, then app).

3) Backups & recovery

Daily DB backups retained 30 days; test a restore monthly.

Versioned buckets and lifecycle rules (e.g., temp uploads purge after 7d).

4) Accessibility

All interactive elements reachable via keyboard; visible focus ring.

Modals trap focus; Escape closes; ARIA labels on buttons like “Recent”, “Invite”.

5) UX polish

Optimistic UI for list adds (documents/photos), with rollback on failure.

Toasts for success/fail.

Non-blocking loaders (skeletons for cards/grids).

Clear empty states (“No photos yet—Upload to get started”).

6) Internationalization/Localization (future-proof)

Wrap strings in a small i18n layer; store locale per user.

Date/time localized; always store UTC.

7) Legal pages

Public Privacy Policy and Terms.

In-product Data Processing Addendum if/when you serve EU residents.

Email footers with physical address and unsubscribe (for non-transactional emails).

Drop-in snippets

Express security headers (helmet-lite):

app.use((_, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload");
  res.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
  res.setHeader("Referrer-Policy", "strict-origin-when-cross-origin");
  res.setHeader("Permissions-Policy", "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()");
  res.setHeader("Content-Security-Policy",
    "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: https://cdn.familycirclesecure.com; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'self' https://your-s3-endpoint; frame-ancestors 'none'"
  );
  next();
});


Basic rate limit (express-rate-limit):

import rateLimit from "express-rate-limit";

const sensitiveLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000,
  max: 5, // 5/min/user/IP
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
app.post("/api/passwords/credentials/:id/reveal", sensitiveLimiter, revealHandler);


S3 bucket policy (private by default):
Keep buckets private; rely on pre-signed URLs and CDN origin access where applicable.

Rollout order (recommended)

Apply headers, auth, rate limits.

Enforce upload MIME/size + quarantine/AV queue.

Add image thumbnails worker + CDN caching.

Turn on audit logs for sensitive flows.

Stand up backups and test a restore.

Add metrics & alerts (error rate spikes, queue stuck, AV failures).
