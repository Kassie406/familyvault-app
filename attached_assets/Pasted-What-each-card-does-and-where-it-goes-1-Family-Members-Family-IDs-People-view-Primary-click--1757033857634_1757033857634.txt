What each card does (and where it goes)
1) Family Members → Family IDs (People view)

Primary click on card:
/family-ids?tab=people&sort=recent (highlights People)

Dropdown items

Add person → /family-ids/new?type=person

Invite family member → /invitations/new?context=family

Manage roles & access → /settings/access?scope=family

Recent activity (same preview) → “View all” → /family-ids/activity?scope=people

Why this is good: It reuses your Family IDs source of truth. No duplicate concepts. The stat now feels like a quick portal into the People area.

2) Documents Shared → Inbox / Sharing

Primary click on card:
/inbox?filter=shared&sort=recent
(If you prefer a dedicated page: /sharing)

Dropdown items

Share a document → /share/new (opens the same flow you already have for share links)

Manage link policies → /settings/sharing (expiry defaults, require login, audit)

Pending approvals (if you add approvals) → /inbox?filter=pending-approval

Recent activity → /inbox/activity?filter=shared

Nice addition: On this page show “Shared by me” vs “Shared with me."

3) Messages Today → Messages

Primary click on card:
/messages?view=threads&sort=latest

Dropdown items

New message → /messages/new (or opens the composer modal)

Family group chat → /messages/thread/family

Mentions & alerts → /messages?filter=mentions

Recent activity → /messages/activity?date=today

Optional: Tie message counts to family groups and managers so the user can filter quickly.

4) Photos Uploaded → Photos / Gallery

Primary click on card:
/photos?sort=recent

Dropdown items

Upload photos → /photos/upload (dropzone modal is great here)

Albums → /photos/albums

Shared galleries → /photos?filter=shared

Recent activity → /photos/activity?date=today

Bonus: On the gallery page, surface “From shared links” vs “Private” filters to connect with Documents/Sharing.

How the preview + “View all” ties in

Your preview panel already shows “RECENT” items. For each panel:

“View all” routes to the “Recent activity” endpoint listed above.

Each item in the preview is clickable and deep-links to exactly where it lives (person profile, shared doc, message thread, photo).

Recommended routes & permissions (quick map)
/family-ids
  ?tab=people            # main People grid
  /new?type=person       # quick add flow
  /person/:id            # profile with all items
  /activity?scope=people # audit stream

/inbox                   # documents & items shared with/to you
  ?filter=shared
  /activity?filter=shared

/messages
  ?view=threads
  /new
  /thread/:id
  ?filter=mentions
  /activity?date=today

/photos
  ?sort=recent
  /upload
  /albums
  /activity?date=today

/settings
  /access?scope=family   # roles/ACL
  /sharing               # link defaults, expirations, require-login


Permissions:

Family Manager & Owner: all actions.

Member: view most stats, limited actions (e.g., can’t change sharing defaults).

Card hover and interactions (keeping your style)

No hover background. Icons glow gold; label can softly tint—already done.

Preview only opens via the “Recent” chevron button (not on hover).

Outside click + Esc close the preview (already implemented).

Card click = primary route above.

Empty states (so it never feels broken)

0 Family Members → prompt “Add Person” + link to /family-ids/new?type=person.

0 Shared Documents → invite to “Share a document”.

0 Messages Today → show “Start a message”.

0 Photos → show “Upload photos”.

Analytics (super helpful later)

Track:

statcard.click (which card)

statcard.preview.open/close

statcard.preview.item_click (target type/id)

quick_action.click (e.g., “Add person”, “Upload photos”)
