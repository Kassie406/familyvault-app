, let’s polish your Coupons tab 🚀

Right now, you’ve got a black card with “No Coupons Yet” and a Create Coupon button. It’s consistent with the other tabs, but it feels a bit empty and doesn’t give admins much context. Here’s how we can improve:

✅ What’s Good

Consistent empty state structure.

Bright Create Coupon button (yellow stands out nicely).

Clear CTA: “Create your first promotional coupon.”

⚖️ Improvements
1. Lighten Empty State

Right now, the dark background looks disconnected from your other polished sections (like Users & Subscription Plans).

Suggestion: use a white or light card with subtle border/shadow (like in Subscription Plans table).

Keep the icon (🎟️ ticket) but center it in a softer style.

2. Explain Coupon Use

Add a short explainer for admins so they know what coupons can do. For example:

“Coupons let you offer discounts on subscription plans. Apply them globally or restrict to specific plans. Set fixed or percentage discounts with optional expiration dates.”

This educates new admins.

3. Coupon Table (Once Coupons Exist)

When coupons are created, show them in a structured table:

Code	Discount	Applies To	Expiration	Uses	Status	Actions
WELCOME10	10% off	All plans	12/31/2025	143	Active	Edit / Disable
FREE3MO	Free 3 mo	Gold & Silver	06/30/2025	87	Active	Edit / Disable
BETA2025	$5 off	Silver only	No expiration	23	Expired	Archive
4. Create Coupon Modal

When you click + Create Coupon, open a modal with fields:

Code (auto-generate option)

Type: Percentage | Fixed amount | Free trial

Value: (10%, $5, 1 month free)

Applies To: All Plans | Specific Plans (multi-select)

Max Uses: (optional)

Expiration Date: (optional)

Status: Active / Inactive

⚡ This mirrors Stripe’s coupon structure and keeps you flexible.

5. Visuals for Coupons

Add badges for discount type:

% for percentage

$ for fixed amount

🎁 for free trial

Color-code status:

Active → Green

Expired → Gray

Disabled → Red
