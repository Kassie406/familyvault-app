he Security page—nice foundation. To make it feel consistent with the rest of the site and land stronger trust, here’s a tight, action-ready pass.

What’s working

Clean hero with a plainspoken intro.

Clear “promise” pillars (Fortress / Privacy / Ownership).

Deep details below (MFA, biometrics, tokenization, etc.).

Compliance grid + FAQ: exactly what evaluators look for.

High-impact fixes (prioritized)

Unify theme + visual language

Use the same dark theme tokens as other lifecycle pages:

Background: #0E0E0E / panels #121212–#151515

Accent (links, bullets, icons): brand yellow you’re using elsewhere

Card borders: 1px #2A2A2A; shadows off or super subtle

Turn the colored compliance tiles into mono panels with the yellow accent for icons/badges. The current pastel tiles feel off-brand.

Hero: add trust CTAs + metadata

Keep H1: “Security”

Subhead: one sentence; then add small meta row:

“Last updated: Mar 2025 • SOC 2 Type II • ISO 27001 Ready”

Two CTAs side-by-side (yellow primary / outline secondary):

“Read our Trust Overview (PDF)”

“Contact Security” (mailto/security@… or form)

Add a slim Status chip linking to your status page.

Make the promise section scannable

Convert each pillar into:

24px icon (outlined, yellow)

Title (1 line) + one sentence

“Learn more” chevron → expands a 3–4 bullet list

Keep line length ≈ 65–75 chars for readability.

Restructure the long-form tech content

Replace the big paragraphs with accordion groups:

Account Security (MFA mandatory, strong password, device trust)

Data Protection (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+, tokenization)

Platform Security (biometrics, hardware keys, screen privacy)

AI & Privacy (We do not train AI on your data; zero-memory ops)

Operations (audits, background checks, least privilege)

Incident Response (24/7 on-call, RTO/RPO targets, status page)

This mirrors how buyers evaluate and keeps the page light on mobile.

Compliance + Evidence

For each badge add a tiny link: “View letter / report” (even if it’s a redacted sample or “available under NDA”).

Put scope copy under SOC 2 Type II (e.g., “Security, Availability”).

Add Data Residency (where data is stored) + Data Retention & Deletion (what happens on cancel; ties to FAQ answer).

FAQ: tighten + add schema

Keep 5–6 items, each 2–3 sentences max.

Add:

“Where is my data stored?” (regions / provider)

“How do I export or delete everything?” (one-click export + SLA)

Implement FAQPage structured data so this content can surface in search.

Accessibility & consistency

Ensure all yellow on dark meets contrast (≥ 4.5:1). If current yellow fails, slightly darken it on text and keep bright for fills/icons only.

Add a sticky Table of Contents on desktop (jumps to anchors).

Keyboard focus states: 2px focus ring in brand yellow.

Use a semantic heading ladder (H1 → H2 sections → H3 items).

Microcopy tune-ups (examples)

Fortress-Level Protection → Defense-grade protection

We encrypt data in transit and at rest with AES-256 and TLS. All access is protected by mandatory multi-factor authentication.

Complete Ownership → You control your data

You choose who sees what, for how long. Export anytime. We never sell or train AI on your data.

Illustration/diagram

Add a single architecture diagram (simple, monochrome) showing:
Browser → TLS → App → Encrypted DB / KMS → Backups (encrypted).

Caption: “High-level architecture (not to scale).”

Footer call-to-action

Mirror other pages: yellow primary “Start your free trial” + ghost “Read full security overview”.

Quick content swaps you can lift

AI & Privacy (callout box)

We do not train AI on your data.
Our AI features run with a zero-memory design: prompts and documents aren’t stored or used to improve models. Third-party AI, when used, runs on our private cloud with strict data-processing agreements.

Data retention & deletion (FAQ)

You can export all data at any time. When you cancel, we start a 30-day grace period (access only). After 30 days, we begin deletion from primary systems and encrypted backups per our backup rotation policy.

Component checklist (for devs/designers)

 Replace pastel compliance cards with dark cards + yellow icon

 Add hero metadata row + dual CTAs + status chip

 Implement accordion groups with deep links (#mfa, #encryption, …)

 Add TOC (desktop sticky) + back-to-top button

 Insert SVG architecture diagram (lazy-loaded)

 Add FAQPage JSON-LD

 Audit contrast + focus states; unify spacing to 8pt grid

 Compress new SVGs; defer non-critical images; keep LCP clean
