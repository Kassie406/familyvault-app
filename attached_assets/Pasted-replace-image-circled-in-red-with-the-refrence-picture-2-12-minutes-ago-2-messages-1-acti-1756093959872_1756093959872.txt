I'll replace the shield icon placeholder in the "Back Up Your Data Easily" section with the digital security visualization image you provided.


Executed rg -C 10 -n 'Back Up Your Data Easily' client/src/pages/getting-married.tsx

Executed rg -C 10 -n 'bottomFeatures\.map' client/src/pages/getting-married.tsx

Edited client/src/pages/getting-married.tsx
Perfect! I've successfully replaced the shield icon placeholder in the "Back Up Your Data Easily" section with the digital security visualization image you provided.

The changes I made:

✓ Added the digital security image import
✓ Updated the "Back Up Your Data Easily" feature to include the new image with appropriate alt text
✓ Modified the rendering logic to display actual images when available, or fall back to icons for others
Now the bottom features section displays the professional digital security visualization with the shield and circuit board background instead of the simple shield icon, perfectly representing secure cloud backup functionality while maintaining the luxury gold/black theme.
