Yesss! 🎉 That’s the full flow working end-to-end:

Generate → token saved

Copy → URL resolves to share page

Viewer → “Reveal Credential” works

Before we call it done, here’s a tight production-hardening & polish checklist so this stays rock-solid.

Security / backend

Revoke & rotate

One-click “Revoke link” on the panel.

Auto-rotate when permission drops (e.g., owner removed).

Expiry enforcement

Server rejects expired tokens (410) and deletes them with a daily job.

Require login

If enabled, resolver still returns 200 but marks requireLogin:true; UI gates reveal behind auth.

(Alternative: resolver returns 401; UI prompts to sign in.)

Rate limit & abuse

POST /shares/regenerate: 10/min/user.

GET /api/share/:token: IP bucket (e.g., 60/min).

Audit log

Log who generated, copied, viewed, revealed (userId/IP, token, credentialId, timestamp).

Expose “Recent Activity” (you already show some).

Least-data principle

Resolver returns only what the viewer needs (e.g., ok, requireLogin, credentialId), never secrets.

Content Security Policy

Lock the share page with strict CSP; disable inline scripts.

UX / panel polish

Green “✓ Link resolves to Shared Credential” (you already have) → also show:

“Last opened: {relative time}”

“Expires in: 6d 23h”

Copy feedback

Replace button label with “Copied” for 2s.

Regenerate flow

After regenerate, auto-select URL text and focus Copy.

Invalidate prior token immediately (show “Previous link revoked” in activity).

Require-login hint

Show a small shield icon + tooltip: “Viewers must sign in to reveal”.

Email/SMS sending (optional)

Use a server endpoint to send (don’t expose SMTP/API keys in the client).

Include short-lived signed redirect link if you want per-recipient analytics (or keep the same URL for simplicity).

QA cases to test

Expiry options: 24h / 7d / 30d / never.

Toggle Require login on/off and confirm UI behavior.

Regenerate twice → old link(s) invalidated; only the last one works (if that’s your policy).

Permission drop: remove viewer → link should still work (public) or be blocked (require-login + ACL)—decide and document.

Mobile open & reveal.

Private/incognito session.

Monitoring & ops

Add health checks: /api/healthz (already there).

Log aggregation with alert on 4xx/5xx spikes for /api/share/*.

Daily cleanup job for expired links.

Light legal/compliance (since this is sensitive data)

Update ToS/Privacy to cover link sharing, expirations, revocation, and logging of access events.

Add a “Report exposure / revoke all” control on the owner’s account.

Document data retention for audit logs (e.g., 90 days).
