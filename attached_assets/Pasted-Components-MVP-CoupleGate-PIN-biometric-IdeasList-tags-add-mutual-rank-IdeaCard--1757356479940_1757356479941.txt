Permissions

Gate all endpoints with couple_id membership (both partners only).

Children: couple events render as Busy (time blocks only).

No analytics inside /couple; only couple-visible audit_couple.

Calendar integration

Couple events stored in couple_events and also projected into the main calendar feed with:

isCouple: true

visibility: 'busy' for non-parents

Conflict detector: when adding a date, query family events in window; show chips:

Conflicts: Soccer 6–7p, Chores 7–7:30p.

Notifications (gentle)

Upcoming date: 24h + 3h reminders.

“Open Date” today → pick 1 of 3 ideas (fit time/budget).

Weekly check-in reminder on chosen evening.

“On This Day” resurfacing (opt-in).

Copy (ready to paste)

Card title: Our Connection
Card subtitle: Next date: Fri 7:30 PM • Italian place near home

Gate explainer: This space is private to the two of you. Add a quick PIN to enter.

Open Date banner: You saved 7–9 PM for each other. Try one of these?

Check-in prompts (weekly):

One thing that made you smile this week?

One thing you appreciated about your partner?

One small thing to try next week?

Acceptance criteria (MVP)

 Parents see Our Connection card; children do not.

 PIN gate required once per session (configurable).

 Add idea → appears for both partners; mutual ranking works.

 Add idea to calendar → conflict chips visible; reminders fire.

 “Open Date” blocks suggest ≤3 ideas matching duration/budget.

 Journal entries accept text + up to 10 photos; “On This Day” works when opted in.

 Weekly check-in saves rating + 3 answers; partners see a tiny sparkline only.

 Couple events hidden from kids (show as Busy).

Design notes

Keep gold/dark theme; add warmer micro-accents inside /couple (soft gradient headers).

Buttons: gentle wording (“Plan together”, “Save for Friday”).

Privacy microcopy on every screen footer: Only the two of you can see this.

Rollout

Sprint A: Gate, Ideas, CoupleCalendar, conflicts, reminders.

Sprint B: Journal + “On This Day,” Weekly Check-in, Milestones.

Pilot: 10–20 couples; tune prompts + suggestion rules.

V2 (after pilot): Budget category integration, Love Languages inventory + tailored idea packs, Vision Board & long-term goals, local events recommendations.

Success signals (internal)

30% of couples schedule ≥1 date within 14 days.

Median 2+ couple events/month after 30 days.

50% of opted-in couples complete at least 2 weekly check-ins in first month.
