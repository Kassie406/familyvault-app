üîß Updates for Elderly Parents Page

Hero Section (Top Banner)

The image of the daughter cooking with her father should span the full container width with rounded corners (rounded-2xl) instead of the small floating box.

Add a subtle gradient overlay (black ‚Üí transparent) on the left side so the white text stands out more clearly.

Make the ‚ÄúGet Started Free‚Äù button slightly larger (py-3 px-6 text-lg) and add hover glow (hover:shadow-lg hover:bg-[#FFD700] transition).

Information Grid (Medical Info, Financial Docs, etc.)

Current boxes look stiff. Add:

rounded-xl border border-[#FFD700]/30 hover:shadow-lg hover:scale-105 transition


Use gold gradient icons instead of plain line icons. This makes each feature pop and align with your gold/black brand.

Mid-Page Feature Blocks (Coordinate Medical Care, Monitor Finances, etc.)

Right now, images sit on one side and text on the other. Make them card-style blocks with soft background (bg-[#111] border border-[#FFD700]/20 rounded-xl p-6) so they don‚Äôt float awkwardly.

Alternate layout: First block (image left, text right), second block (image right, text left). Creates visual rhythm.

Testimonials Section (What Our Members Say)

Instead of floating review boxes, put them in a carousel slider with gold star icons.

Style the testimonial cards:

bg-[#1a1a1a] border border-[#FFD700]/20 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-md


Add reviewer avatars in circle frames with a gold border.

Checklist / Resources Section

Those flat boxes (‚ÄúHelping Elderly Parents: The Complete Guide‚Äù) look too plain. Add icons for each guide, like a book for ‚ÄúComplete Guide,‚Äù a balance scale for ‚ÄúLegal Considerations,‚Äù etc.

Use a horizontal scroll style (like cards you swipe left/right) instead of stacked boxes. This makes it feel more modern.

Final CTA (Bottom Banner)

Right now it‚Äôs plain black. Change to a subtle gradient background (bg-gradient-to-r from-black via-[#222] to-black) with a large gold button.

Add small reassuring text under button:
