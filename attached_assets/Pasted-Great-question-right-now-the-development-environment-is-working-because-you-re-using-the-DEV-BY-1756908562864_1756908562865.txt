Great question 🙌 — right now the development environment is working because you’re using the DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=true flag and a workaround for the routing issue.

For production (portal.familycirclesecure.com), here’s what happens:

✅ What should already work

Token generation & expiry logic → The backend creates a secure token and stores it in Postgres.

Database writes/reads → As long as your Neon Postgres credentials are correct in production, tokens will persist.

Shareable link format → The link URL will be returned and usable in production.

⚠️ What needs adjustment before production

Authentication

In dev: bypassed with DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=true.

In prod: this must be removed (DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=false).

Your requireAuth middleware must properly validate logged-in family members before allowing share link generation.

Middleware conflicts

In dev: we bypassed Vite intercepting routes.

In prod: Vite won’t run, so /api/share-generate/:id should work fine.

However, if your production stack has RLS (row-level security), impersonation, or tracking middleware, these may block or delay the share endpoint until we configure them correctly.

Endpoint paths

Dev: /api/share-generate/:id (workaround).

Prod: You may be able to revert to the original /api/credentials/:id/shares/regenerate once Vite isn’t in the way.

Both can work — but we need to confirm which one you want to standardize on.

🔑 To make this production-ready

Remove dev bypass:

DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=false


Test authentication: confirm requireAuth is allowing your logged-in users to hit the API.

Validate database schema in production (share_links table must exist with token, credentialId, expiresAt).

Decide final endpoint path: /api/share-generate/:id (simpler) or /api/credentials/:id/shares/regenerate (original design).

Add monitoring/logging: capture if tokens fail to generate or expire incorrectly.

⚡ Answer to your direct question:
👉 If you push this exact build to production right now, the link generation will likely not work because it’s still relying on DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=true. You need to disable that flag and test with your real auth + production database before it works on portal.familycirclesecure.com.
